# **Solar System Simulation**  

This project is a Python-based simulation of planetary motion using the **Pygame** library. The simulation visualizes celestial bodiesâ€”planets, moons, and spacecraftâ€”moving in a solar system-like environment based on **Newtonian physics**. It provides an interactive and educational experience by accurately depicting the movement of planets around the Sun and the space telescope (JWST) orbiting at the Lagrange-2 (L2) point.  

The project aims to bring the beauty  of celestial mechanics to life with **realistic orbital movements**, dynamic planetary interactions, and a visually engaging display of our solar system's inner planets. To enhance the experience, **background music from the *Interstellar Soundtrack*** plays during the simulation, immersing users in the wonders of space.

## **Features**  

### **1. Realistic Orbital Mechanics**  
- Planets and moons follow elliptical orbits based on **Newtonâ€™s laws of motion** and **gravitational attraction**.  
- Orbital speeds and distances are proportional to real-world values, thus ensuring an accurate representation of celestial motion.  

### **2. Celestial Bodies Modeled in the Simulation**  
- **The Sun** â€“ The central gravitational body holding the system together.  
- **Mercury** â€“ The closest planet to the Sun, moving at the highest orbital speed.  
- **Venus** â€“ A rocky planet with a thick and dense atmosphere.  
- **Earth & Moon** â€“ The Earthâ€™s Moon orbits around it while Earth revolves around the Sun.  
- **Mars & its Moons (Phobos & Deimos)** â€“ Two small irregularly shaped moons orbiting Mars.  
- **Spacecraft (JWST)** â€“ The **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)** is stationed at **L2**, orbiting the Sun in sync with Earth.  

### **3. Graphical and Interactive Elements**  
- **Visual representation of orbits**: Each planet and moon follows a **traced path** for a clear understanding of its motion.  
- **Accurate distance scaling**: While distances are adjusted for screen size, the proportional relationships between celestial bodies are maintained.  
- **Smooth animations**: Pygame ensures a fluid display of planetary motion.  

### **4. Background Music**  
- To add an immersive touch, the **Interstellar Soundtrack** plays in the background.  
- The music file (`Interstellar Soundtrack.mp3`) must be placed in the project directory for the feature to work.

## **Requirements**  

To run the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:  

- **Python** (latest version recommended)  
- **Pygame** (for rendering graphics and handling animations)  
- **An MP3 file** named `"Interstellar Soundtrack.mp3"` in the project directory

## **Installation & Usage**  

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/Solar-System-Simulation.git
cd Solar-System-Simulation
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### **Step 3: Add Background Music**  
Ensure the `"Interstellar Soundtrack.mp3"` file is present in the project directory.  

### **Step 4: Run the Simulation**  
```bash
python solar_system.py
```

Once executed, this simulation will visualize planetary motion with smooth animations and background music.
