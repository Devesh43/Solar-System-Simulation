# Solar-System-Simulation
This is a Python-based planet simulation project using Pygame. The simulation visualizes celestial bodies, including planets, moons, and spacecraft, moving in a solar system-like environment. The project features the movement of inner planets around the Sun, their respective moons, and a space telescope (JWST) stationed at the L2 point.


# Features
- Realistic orbital mechanics using Newtonian physics.
- Display of multiple celestial bodies, including:
  - The Sun
  - Earth and its Moon
  - Mars and its moons (Phobos and Deimos)
  - Mercury and Venus
- Spacecraft (JWST) following its orbit around Earth.
- Visual representation of orbits and distances.
- Background music from the *Interstellar Soundtrack* for an immersive experience.

# Requirements
-Python 
-Pygame
-An MP3 file named "Interstellar Soundtrack.mp3" in the project directory

# Installation & Usage
-Clone this repository
-Install Pygame: pip install pygame
-Add "Interstellar Soundtrack.mp3" to the project directory
-Run: python solar_system.py

# Acknowledgments
Pygame for the graphical interface.
Inspired by real celestial mechanics and the beauty of space exploration.
